# Iridium 9603N Beacon

A lightweight Iridium 9603N + GNSS Beacon (Tracker)

Suitable for high altitude ballooning, asset tracking and many other remote monitoring applications.

New hardware features for Version 5:
- Includes an OMRON G6SK relay to allow the beacon to control external equipment (e.g. a cut-down device)
- 9603N EXT_PWR is now switched via a P-MOSFET

New software features for Version 5:
- Relay can be configured during a flight via a Mobile Terminated SBD message
