## Iridium 9603N Beacon - V5 Gerber Files

This directory contains the Gerber files for the V5 PCB.

**Please note that these files have only been checked by eye using [gerbv](http://gerbv.geda-project.org/), they haven't yet been used directly for manufacture.**
The PCB shown in the images was manufactured by [Multi-CB](https://www.multi-circuit-boards.eu/en/index.html) directly from the Eagle .brd file.

Please make sure that the milling file is included during manufacture - this is required to produce the plated-through slits for the USB connector.
